## Technical Details

### Royalties vs Treasury

**Royalties** (what this dashboard claims):
- Come from secondary sales on marketplaces
- Stored in the TransferPolicy balance
- Require TransferPolicyCap to withdraw
- Current balance: ~23.43 SUI

**Treasury** (separate funds):
- Come from primary NFT minting
- Sent directly to treasury address
- Require treasury wallet private key to access
- View-only in this dashboard

### Smart Contract

The Puppets NFT collection uses Sui's standard `TransferPolicy` for royalty enforcement. The `withdraw` function is called to claim accumulated fees:

```move
public fun withdraw<T>(
    policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,
    cap: &TransferPolicyCap<T>,
    amount: Option<u64>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): Coin<SUI>
```

## Security Notes

- This dashboard only reads public blockchain data
- Transactions require explicit wallet approval
- No private keys are stored or transmitted
- All RPC calls go directly to Sui mainnet
- Open source - review the code before use

## Troubleshooting

### Connect button does nothing / No wallet detected

**Solution:**
1. Install the [Sui Wallet extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil)
2. Make sure the extension is **enabled** in your browser
3. **Refresh the page** after installing
4. Open browser console (F12) and check for logs
5. Look for `window.suiWallets:` in console - should not be `undefined`

**Still not working?**
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Brave, or Edge)
- Disable other wallet extensions temporarily
- Check console for error messages
- Make sure you're using the latest Sui Wallet version

### "Permission Required" message
- You need to connect with the wallet that owns the TransferPolicyCap
- Check the displayed cap owner address matches your wallet
- The dashboard shows both addresses so you can verify

### Transaction fails
- Ensure you have enough SUI for gas fees (~0.01 SUI)
- Check that you're connected to Sui Mainnet (not Testnet)
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
- Check the transaction error in console (F12)

### Balance not updating
- Wait 2-3 seconds after transaction confirmation
- Refresh the page manually if needed
- Check transaction on SuiScan using the provided link

### Wallet connects but shows errors
- Open browser console (F12) and look for red error messages
- Check if you're on the correct network (Mainnet)
- Verify your wallet has some SUI for gas fees
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the wallet
